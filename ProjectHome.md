# BSD# #

The BSD# Project is devoted to porting and maintaining the **Mono** .NET framework and applications for **FreeBSD**.

The repository currently contains FreeBSD ports for the framework, libraries and third parties applications released, that are not in the main FreeBSD ports tree, with the intent that they will be intergrated ones they are ready.

The project aims to act as a central testing point for porting new releases for introducing new applications, and for testing framework wide changes that will affect all applications that rely on Mono before they reach the FreeBSD ports tree.
